@article{Immerman1982,
abstract = {We study first order expressibility as a measure of complexity. We introduce the new class Var{\&}Sz[v(n),z(n)] of languages expressible by a uniform sequence of sentences with v(n) variables and size O[z(n)]. When v(n) is constant our uniformity condition is syntactical and thus the following characterizations of P and PSPACE come entirely from logic. NSPACE|log n|??? {\{}n-ary union{\}} k=1,2,...Var{\&}Sz|k, log(n)|???DSPACE|log2(n)|,P= {\{}n-ary union{\}} k=1,2,...Var{\&}Sz|k, nk|,PSPACE= {\{}n-ary union{\}} k=1,2,...Var{\&}Sz|k, 2nk|. The above means, for example, that the properties expressible with constantly many variables in polynomial size sentences are just the polynomial time recognizable properties. These results hold for languages with an ordering relation, e.g., for graphs the vertices are numbered. We introduce an "alternating pebbling game" to prove lower bounds on the number of variables and size needed to express properties without the ordering. We show, for example, that k variables are needed to express Clique(k), suggesting that this problem requires DTIME[nk]. ?? 1982.},

@book{Ebbinghaus,
abstract = {The book presents the main results of descriptive complexity theory, that is, the connections between axiomatizability of classes of finite structures and their complexity with respect to time and space bounds. The logics that are important in this context include fixed-point logics, transitive closure logics, and also certain infinitary languages; their model theory is studied in full detail. Other topics include DATALOG languages, quantifiers and oracles, 0-1 laws, and optimization and approximation problems. The book is written in such a way that the respective parts on model theory and descriptive complexity theory may be read independently. This second edition is a thoroughly revised and enlarged version of the original text.},

A number of such operators, generalizing inductive de nitions, have been studied in the context of nite model theory, including nondeterministic and alternating operators. We review results established in nite model theory, and also consider the ex- pressive power of the resulting logics on in nite structures. In particular, we establish the relationship between in ationary and nondeterministic xed point logics and second order logic, and we consider questions re- lated to the determinacy of games associated with alternating xed points.},

@article{Kolaitis1992,
abstract = {In recent years several extensions of first-order$\backslash$nlogic have been investigated in the context of$\backslash$nfinite-model theory. Fixpoint logic and the infinitary$\backslash$nlogic{\~{}}L{\^{}}$\omega${\_}{\{}$\backslash$infty$\omega${\}} with a finite number of$\backslash$nvariables have turned out to be of particular$\backslash$nimportance. The study of fixpoint logic generated$\backslash$ninteractions with both database theory and complexity$\backslash$ntheory, while the infinitary$\backslash$nlogic{\~{}}L{\^{}}$\omega${\_}{\{}$\backslash$infty$\omega${\}} proved to be a useful$\backslash$ntool for analyzing the expressive power of fixpoint$\backslash$nlogic. In addition to being a proper extension of$\backslash$nfixpoint logic, L{\^{}}$\omega${\_}{\{}$\backslash$infty$\omega${\}} enjoys a$\backslash$ngame-theoretic characterization and possesses$\backslash$ninteresting structural properties, such as the 0-1 law.$\backslash$n$\backslash$par In this paper we pursue further the study of the$\backslash$nrelationship between L{\^{}}$\omega${\_}{\{}$\backslash$infty$\omega${\}} and$\backslash$nfixpoint logic. We observe that equivalence of two$\backslash$nfinite structures with respect$\backslash$nto{\~{}}L{\^{}}$\omega${\_}{\{}$\backslash$infty$\omega${\}} is expressible in fixpoint$\backslash$nlogic. As a first application of this, we obtain a$\backslash$nnormal-form theorem for{\~{}}L{\^{}}$\omega${\_}{\{}$\backslash$infty$\omega${\}} on$\backslash$nfinite structures. We then focus on the relative$\backslash$nexpressive power of first-order logic, fixpoint logic,$\backslash$nand L{\^{}}$\omega${\_}{\{}$\backslash$infty$\omega${\}} on arbitrary classes of$\backslash$nfinite structures. Our second main result characterizes$\backslash$nwhen L{\^{}}$\omega${\_}{\{}$\backslash$infty$\omega${\}} collapses to first-order$\backslash$nlogic on an arbitrary class of finite structures. This$\backslash$nresolves affirmatively a conjecture of G. L. McColm.},
