abstract = {It is shown that {\&}Omega;n variables are needed for first-order logic with counting to identify graphs on n vertices. This settles a long-standing open problem. The lower bound remains true over a set of graphs of color class size 4. This contrasts sharply with the fact that three variables suffice to identify all graphs of color class size 3, and two variables suffice to identify almost all graphs. The lower bound is optimal up to multiplication by a constant because n variables obviously suffice to identify graphs on n vertices},

A number of such operators, generalizing inductive de nitions, have been studied in the context of nite model theory, including nondeterministic and alternating operators.

abstract = {We study first order expressibility as a measure of complexity. We introduce the new class Var{\&}Sz[v(n),z(n)] of languages expressible by a uniform sequence of sentences with v(n) variables and size O[z(n)]. When v(n) is constant our uniformity condition is syntactical and thus the following characterizations of P and PSPACE come entirely from logic. NSPACE|log n|??? {\{}n-ary union{\}} k=1,2,...Var{\&}Sz|k, log(n)|???DSPACE|log2(n)|,P= {\{}n-ary union{\}} k=1,2,...Var{\&}Sz|k, nk|,PSPACE= {\{}n-ary union{\}} k=1,2,...Var{\&}Sz|k, 2nk|. The above means, for example, that the properties expressible with constantly many variables in polynomial size sentences are just the polynomial time recognizable properties. These results hold for languages with an ordering relation, e.g., for graphs the vertices are numbered. We introduce an "alternating pebbling game" to prove lower bounds on the number of variables and size needed to express properties without the ordering. We show, for example, that k variables are needed to express Clique(k), suggesting that this problem requires DTIME[nk]. ?? 1982.},

abstract = {The extensions of first-order logic with a least fixed point operator (FO + LFP) and with a partial fixed point operator (FO + PFP) are known to capture the complexity classes P and PSPACE respectively in the presence of an ordering relation over finite structures. Recently, Abiteboul and Vianu (in "Proceedings of the 23rd ACM Symposium on the Theory of Computing," 1991) investigated the relationship of these two logics in the absence of an ordering, using a machine model of generic computation. In particular, they showed that the two languages have equivalent expressive power if and only if P = PSPACE. These languages can also be seen as fragments of an infinitary logic where each formula has a bounded number of variables, L$\omega$∞$\omega$, (see, for instance, Kolaitis and Vardi, in "Proceedings of the 5th IEEE Symposium on Logic in Computer Science," pp. 156-167, 1990). We investigate this logic on finite structures and provide a normal form for it. We also present a treatment of Abiteboul and Vianu′s results from this point of view. In particular, we show that we can write a formula of FO + LFP that defines an ordering of the Lk∞$\omega$, types uniformly over all finite structures. One consequence of this is a generalization of the equivalence of FO + LFP and P from ordered structures to classes of structures where every element is definable. We also settle a conjecture mentioned by Abiteboul and Vianu by showing that FO + LFP is properly contained in the polynomial time computable fragment of L$\omega$∞$\omega$, raising the question of whether the latter fragment is a recursively enumerable class.},

abstract = {Suppose we are given a set of generators for a group G of permutations of a colored set A. The color automorphism problem for G involves finding generators for the subgroup of G which stabilizes the color classes. It is shown that testing isomorphism of graphs of bounded valance is polynomial-time reducible to the color automorphism problem for groups with composition factors of bounded order. The algorithm for the latter problem involves three divide-and-conquer maneuvers. The problem is solved sequentially on the G-orbits. An orbit is broken into a minimal system of imprimitivity blocks. At that point, the hypothesis on G guarantees the presence of a subgroup P of " small " index which acts a p-group on the blocks. Divide-and-conquer is then used on the group, trading the problem on G for a small number of similar problems on P. In the trivalent case p = 2, P = G and the analysis requires only elementary notions. For higher valence, the justification requires some new observations about primitive permutation groups.},

Applying this theorem, we obtain an easy proof of Ruhl's result that reachability (and similarly, connectivity) in finite graphs is not expressible in first-order logic with unary counting quantifiers and addition. Furthermore, the above result on Presburger arithmetic helps to show the failure of a particular version of the Crane Beach conjecture.},
