@article{Luks1982,
abstract = {Suppose we are given a set of generators for a group G of permutations of a colored set A. The color automorphism problem for G involves finding generators for the subgroup of G which stabilizes the color classes. It is shown that testing isomorphism of graphs of bounded valance is polynomial-time reducible to the color automorphism problem for groups with composition factors of bounded order. The algorithm for the latter problem involves three divide-and-conquer maneuvers. The problem is solved sequentially on the G-orbits. An orbit is broken into a minimal system of imprimitivity blocks. At that point, the hypothesis on G guarantees the presence of a subgroup P of " small " index which acts a p-group on the blocks. Divide-and-conquer is then used on the group, trading the problem on G for a small number of similar problems on P. In the trivalent case p = 2, P = G and the analysis requires only elementary notions. For higher valence, the justification requires some new observations about primitive permutation groups.},

The lower bound remains true over a set of graphs of color class size 4. This contrasts sharply with the fact that three variables suffice to identify all graphs of color class size 3, and two variables suffice to identify almost all graphs. The lower bound is optimal up to multiplication by a constant because n variables obviously suffice to identify graphs on n vertices},

abstract = {This paper gives a thorough overview of what is known about first-order logic with counting quantifiers and with arithmetic predicates. As a main theorem we show that Presburger arithmetic is closed under unary counting quantifiers. Precisely, this means that for every first-order formula phi(y,z1,...,zk) over the signature (respectively, over initial segments of this structure) that the variable x is interpreted exactly by the number of possible interpretations of the variable y for which the formula phi(y,z1,...,zk) is satisfied. Applying this theorem, we obtain an easy proof of Ruhl's result that reachability (and similarly, connectivity) in finite graphs is not expressible in first-order logic with unary counting quantifiers and addition. Furthermore, the above result on Presburger arithmetic helps to show the failure of a particular version of the Crane Beach conjecture.},
