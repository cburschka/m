abstract = {We give a novel and simple characterization of first-order logic and its$\backslash$ninfinitary variants with bounded numbers of variables in terms of$\backslash$ncircuit computation. The main feature of the proposed circuit model of$\backslash$nexplicitly symmetric circuits is, that genericity in computations over$\backslash$nstructures is guaranteed through full combinatorial symmetry of circuits$\backslash$nwith respect to permutations of the input representation.$\backslash$nDefinability in the bounded variable fragment of infinitary logic is$\backslash$nequivalent with recognizability in such explicitly symmetric circuits in$\backslash$nwhich the orbits of nodes under symmetry operations are polynomially$\backslash$nbounded. First-order definability is equivalent with recognizability in$\backslash$nfinite depth circuits of that kind.},

@article{Schweikardt2002,
abstract = {This paper gives a thorough overview of what is known about first-order logic with counting quantifiers and with arithmetic predicates. As a main theorem we show that Presburger arithmetic is closed under unary counting quantifiers. Precisely, this means that for every first-order formula phi(y,z1,...,zk) over the signature (respectively, over initial segments of this structure) that the variable x is interpreted exactly by the number of possible interpretations of the variable y for which the formula phi(y,z1,...,zk) is satisfied. Applying this theorem, we obtain an easy proof of Ruhl's result that reachability (and similarly, connectivity) in finite graphs is not expressible in first-order logic with unary counting quantifiers and addition. Furthermore, the above result on Presburger arithmetic helps to show the failure of a particular version of the Crane Beach conjecture.},

We review results established in nite model theory, and also consider the ex- pressive power of the resulting logics on in nite structures. In particular, we establish the relationship between in ationary and nondeterministic xed point logics and second order logic, and we consider questions re- lated to the determinacy of games associated with alternating xed points.},

@article{Luks1982,
abstract = {Suppose we are given a set of generators for a group G of permutations of a colored set A. The color automorphism problem for G involves finding generators for the subgroup of G which stabilizes the color classes. It is shown that testing isomorphism of graphs of bounded valance is polynomial-time reducible to the color automorphism problem for groups with composition factors of bounded order. The algorithm for the latter problem involves three divide-and-conquer maneuvers. The problem is solved sequentially on the G-orbits. An orbit is broken into a minimal system of imprimitivity blocks. At that point, the hypothesis on G guarantees the presence of a subgroup P of " small " index which acts a p-group on the blocks. Divide-and-conquer is then used on the group, trading the problem on G for a small number of similar problems on P. In the trivalent case p = 2, P = G and the analysis requires only elementary notions. For higher valence, the justification requires some new observations about primitive permutation groups.},

The lower bound remains true over a set of graphs of color class size 4. This contrasts sharply with the fact that three variables suffice to identify all graphs of color class size 3, and two variables suffice to identify almost all graphs.

abstract = {We study first order expressibility as a measure of complexity. We introduce the new class Var{\&}Sz[v(n),z(n)] of languages expressible by a uniform sequence of sentences with v(n) variables and size O[z(n)]. When v(n) is constant our uniformity condition is syntactical and thus the following characterizations of P and PSPACE come entirely from logic. NSPACE|log n|??? {\{}n-ary union{\}} k=1,2,...Var{\&}Sz|k, log(n)|???DSPACE|log2(n)|,P= {\{}n-ary union{\}} k=1,2,...Var{\&}Sz|k, nk|,PSPACE= {\{}n-ary union{\}} k=1,2,...Var{\&}Sz|k, 2nk|. The above means, for example, that the properties expressible with constantly many variables in polynomial size sentences are just the polynomial time recognizable properties. These results hold for languages with an ordering relation, e.g., for graphs the vertices are numbered. We introduce an "alternating pebbling game" to prove lower bounds on the number of variables and size needed to express properties without the ordering. We show, for example, that k variables are needed to express Clique(k), suggesting that this problem requires DTIME[nk]. ?? 1982.},
