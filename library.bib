@book{Ebbinghaus1999,
abstract = {The book presents the main results of descriptive complexity theory, that is, the connections between axiomatizability of classes of finite structures and their complexity with respect to time and space bounds. The logics that are important in this context include fixed-point logics, transitive closure logics, and also certain infinitary languages; their model theory is studied in full detail. Other topics include DATALOG languages, quantifiers and oracles, 0-1 laws, and optimization and approximation problems. The book is written in such a way that the respective parts on model theory and descriptive complexity theory may be read independently. This second edition is a thoroughly revised and enlarged version of the original text.},

@article{Dawar2002,
abstract = {We consider xed point logics, i.e. extensions of rst order predicate logic with operators de ning xed points. A number of such operators, generalizing inductive de nitions, have been studied in the context of nite model theory, including nondeterministic and alternating operators. We review results established in nite model theory, and also consider the ex- pressive power of the resulting logics on in nite structures. In particular, we establish the relationship between in ationary and nondeterministic xed point logics and second order logic, and we consider questions re- lated to the determinacy of games associated with alternating xed points.},
